	<h1>The Multitronic Computer</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>The M-1 "Multitronic Computer" website is the first of a series of website designs whose ultimate goal is to
			incorporate elements of machine learning into a practical, adaptable, streamlined and usable program for
			decision making. In this introduction to the Multitronic Computer I will explain it's origins, layout some elements of decision
			making, specify some decisions that developed versions of the Multitronic Computer should arrive at, and suggest further
			research and development.</p>
		<p>The name Multitronic Computer comes from Star Trek the Original Series' M-5 Multitronic Unit (season two,
			episode 24 <a href="http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/The_Ultimate_Computer_(episode)"><i>"The Ultimate Computer"</i></a>).
			In this episode most of the starship Enterprise crew are temporarily replaced by Richard Daystrom's invention,
			the M-5 Multitronic Unit. Equivalent to what we might consider true Artificial Intelligence, the M-5 Computer was
			designed to streamline ship operations and make decisions faster and better than anyone including the captain
			of Enterprise himself. After the Enterprise is largely vacated and M-5 computer testing has begun the remaining
			crew of the Enterprise come to recognize the efficiency and brilliance of the M-5 computer. However, despite it's
			dazzling performance, the bridge crew question whether they would like to serve under computers. A cut scene later
			and the M-5 proves to be an outright disaster, killing the crew of the starship Excalibur in what was supposed
			to be a simulated battle to test it's combat readiness. Proving a danger to the other starships involved in the
			war games, star fleet orders the destruction of the Enterprise by any means necessary. In a last ditch
			effort to save the other ships from the M-5 computer Captain Kirk guilt's the computer for murdering innocent
			Star Fleet officers. With Doctor Daystrom's memory engrams ingrained into it's neural network the M-5 was human enough to
			feel that guilt and realize it had committed a terrible crime. Shortly after the M-5 deactivates itself and the
			Enterprise is saved.</p>
		<p>The name Multitronic Computer was picked specifically to serve as a reminder of the importance of careful
			programing and the continuing need to keep a human at the helm as computers automate more and more of our daily lives. Now to be clear as an aspiring
			computer scientist I am not opposed to computers in the least or even necessarily to true Artificial Intelligence.
			However, since humanity is still in it's infancy of understanding the universe and computers themselves,
			we should tread with caution. In an ideal future, we would create an AI machine of such potential that it can take care of the entire Earth
			and human race as easily as we might care for a garden or a child. Such a machine could conceivably cure all illness, end
			all war, eliminate poverty and end human suffering once and for all. This interestingly is the dream of Star Trek
			and I know we would all love to see that day. If ever we achieve such heights AI would not only be an incredible tool,
			but a new and exciting species unto itself. A being of possibly infinite potential and knowledge. Humanity's greatest creation
			and child for whom the sky is the limit. It's likely that at that stage or even well before it we would be able to upload
			ourselves into such elaborate mainframes achieving virtual immortality (pun intended). Since the concerns over AI are many and the complexity of the debate
			is as infinite as it's potential, I will continue on with the purpose of this site which is to help streamline decision making.
			Perhaps my findings here will aid in whether you decide AI is a good idea or not. </p>
		<h2>Elements of Decision Making</h2>
		<p>One of the first steps to understanding decision making is understanding your own priorities and values. I recently
		listened to the audio book "The Subtle Art of Not Giving an *Explitive*: A Counter Intuitive Approach to Living A
		Good Life" and it revealed some important facts about life. First, I highly recommend reading or listening to this book
		as I can only give a brief exploration of it's relevance here. </p>
		<h2>Test Outcomes for Efficacy of Decision Program</h2>
		<p> At this stage of development I want to list out some conclusions
			which the Multitronic Computer program should also arrive at given various factors and variables.</p>
