		<h1>Computers and Thinking</h1>
		<p>This page is dedicated to some logic and computer ideas which can be related to rational thought and decision making.
			</p>
		<h2>Operators</h2>
		<p>For example, the use of NaN, NaN is supposed to denote the result of a nonsensical computation, and as such, it isnâ€™t equal to the result of any other nonsensical computations. In my view NaN can be applied as a value to irrational thought, unrealistic expectations, intractable problems, or anything else that is just nonsensical to think about (compute).   </p>
		<p>Certainly related to this logic are empty values (null and undefined). These are used to denote the absence of a meaningful value. This seems most applicable to what most people may or may not think of you or thoughts and feelings that bring no meaningful value into your life. Now that isn't to say constructive feedback and considering others is without value! Quite the contrary, we are a social species and we must be considerate and value respect and cooperation. By the same token, sad or angry feelings aren't devoid of meaning. Indeed they can bring real value when tragedy or unfairness strikes. What I do mean by the use of this kind of logic is that certain thoughts and certain opinions can be disregarded as valueless.</p>
